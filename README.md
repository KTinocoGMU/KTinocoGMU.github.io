Hello there! 
My repository consists of the Elizabethan era where the journey starts with a privateer getting ready to raid in Cadiz, Spain in 1587 with Sir Francis Drake. During that time, Philip II was preparing to invade England with his Spanish Armada fleet but ended up getting delayed due to English ships damaging a majority of Spanish ships. We follow the story of one journey which is an accurate timeline while the others are counterfactual timelines with a different outcome.
